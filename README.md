It's a navigational assistant that has all the works of an amateur python programmer:

It's got the poor syntax management.
It's got the offense-to-the-user json readout for locations.
It's got the feeble attempt of a command interpreter.
It's got the obvious amateur code structure.

Powered by a Googlemaps API, and it pretty much does the exact same thing.
It was more for practice, but I may wind up incorporating this somehow

Works on Catalina OS, Windows or Linux are untested.

Feel free to pull requests and actually make this system usable!
Feel free to check out my patreon!
